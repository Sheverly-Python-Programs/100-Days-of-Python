"""
Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string. 
**Warning.** Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

Hint

1. You can put functions inside other functions.
2. Don't try to print anything other than the length.
"""

# Solution:

print(len(input("Your Name: ")))
