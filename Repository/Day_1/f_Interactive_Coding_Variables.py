'''
Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b. 

**Warning.** Do not change the code on lines 1-4 and 12-18. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any value of a and b.

HINT: Think that variable a is like a glass of coffee and variable b is a cup of milk.
Think of a way on how you will switch the milk and coffee on one glass and the other.

ANSWER: You need a new cup. Likewise in Python, you need a new variable.
